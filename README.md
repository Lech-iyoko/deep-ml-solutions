# 🧠 Deep-ML Solutions

This repository curates my solutions, reflections, and utility functions from the [Deep-ML](https://deep-ml.com) challenge platform. It’s part of my learning arc focused on understanding the fundamentals of deep learning and machine learning programming and math, to aid in the development of intelligent systems.

## 📁 Structure

- `challenges/`: Categorized solutions to Deep-ML tasks (e.g. classification, regression, NLP)
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and sandbox trials
- `metadata/`: Tagging schemas, dataset notes, and challenge taxonomy
- `utils/`: Reusable preprocessing and evaluation modules

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Structured learning: a place to learn how to implement the math in code behind these systems, problem solving (main focus really, as an alternative to LeetCode given my goals), and programming syntax for better debugging and computational thinking (to improve this even though we've talked about systematic thinking being my stronger suit).

## 🎯 Goals

This repository is a learning space to deepen my understanding of problem framing, computational thinking, and how to translate mathematical intuition into code. Through these challenges, I'm refining:
- Robust problem-solving instincts across data-driven contexts
- Pseudocode fluency and architecture sense — what makes someone a great engineer
- Programming syntax awareness for faster debugging and cleaner implementation

Each challenge is an intentional exercise in clarity, reasoning, and technical storytelling.

## 👤 About Me

I'm currently preparing for a Master's in AI, using challenge-based learning to build a strong foundation in programming, math, and intelligent system design. My aim is to become a thoughtful practitioner — someone who not only understands technical systems, but builds them to enrich human life with precision and care.
