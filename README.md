# Deep-ML & AI Engineering Solutions

A curated repository documenting my solutions, reflections, and code for machine learning and deep learning programming challenges. This space serves as my personal knowledge base as I bridge the gap between theory and practical engineering.

## About This Repository
This repository is a core part of my learning journey towards a Master's in AI. It tracks my progress on challenges from the Deep-ML platform and custom tasks from my AI coaching sessions. The focus is not just on correct code, but on developing a robust, first-principles approach to problem-solving in AI.

## Goals & Philosophy
This repository is an exercise in clarity, reasoning, and technical implementation. My primary goals are:
- Bridge Theory and Code: Translate mathematical and theoretical concepts from machine learning into clean, functional Python code.
- Develop Problem-Solving Intuition: Build strong analytical and computational thinking skills for data-driven problems.
- Document the Learning Process: Use reflections on each problem to solidify understanding and track my development as an engineer.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized to keep code and context together:

- `challenges/`: Contains all problem solutions, categorized by their source (deep_ml_platform or coaching_sessions) and topic.
  - Each individual challenge has its own folder containing the solution.py and a README.md with my notes and reflections on the approach.

- `utils/`: A library of reusable Python modules for common tasks like data preprocessing or visualization.
