# Deep-ML Solutions

This repository curates my solutions, reflections, and utility functions from the [Deep-ML](https://deep-ml.com) challenge platform. It’s part of my learning arc focused on understanding the fundamentals of deep learning and machine learning programming and math, to aid in the development of intelligent systems.

## Structure

- `challenges/`: Categorized solutions to Deep-ML tasks (e.g. Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, DenseNet, ResNet)
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and sandbox trials
- `metadata/`: Tagging schemas, dataset notes, and challenge taxonomy
- `utils/`: Reusable preprocessing and evaluation modules

## Why This Matters

Structured learning: A place to learn how to implement the math in code behind these systems, problem solving for better computational thinking and learning to read programming syntax.

## Goals

This repository is a learning space to deepen my understanding of problem framing, computational thinking, and how to translate mathematical intuition into code. Through these challenges, I'm refining:
- Robust problem-solving instincts across data-driven contexts
- Pseudocode fluency and architecture sense — what makes someone a great engineer
- Programming syntax awareness for faster debugging and cleaner implementation

Each challenge is an intentional exercise in clarity, reasoning, and technical storytelling.

## About Me

I'm currently preparing for a Master's in AI, using challenge-based learning to build a strong foundation in programming, math, and intelligent system design.
